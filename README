A small python library to consume SOAP services. It can process
a WSDL documents and then use types and methods defined in that
document.

This library is based on some ideas from:
    Scio - http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Scio/0.9.1
    suds - https://fedorahosted.org/suds/
    soaplib - https://github.com/soaplib/soaplib
With many thanks to the contributors of those libraries.

To install do the usual:

    python setup.py install
