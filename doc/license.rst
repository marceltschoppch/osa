License
-------
I release the library under terms of `LGPL`_. I borrowed some ideas from
`suds`_, `soaplib`_ and `Scio`_ libraries. The first two are also released
under `LGPL`_. The last one has its own license, the text of which
and the copyright are given below.

If someone knows better about compatibility of all these licenses,
please let me know.

`Scio`_ license
===============
Please note, that almost no original `Scio`_ code is preserved. Only
algorithm of `WSDL 1.1`_ parsing is partially preserved.
